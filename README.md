This website was built to explain a prediction model using a C5.0 classification 
algorithm to predict the number of consumer complaints filed against various 
organizations matched with unique features.  

This model uses the various inputs and passes the parameters into a python
scoring engine.  This engine was developed based on a model that was created
in IBM's SPSS Modeler.  The results in the model are designed to be estimates
and can not be taken as truth.  This project was purely acadmic and is offered 
online as a source of reference to anyone who wants to learn data-mining.
